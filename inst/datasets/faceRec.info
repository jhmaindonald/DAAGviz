This is a meta-analysis on age effects in face recognition, namely between
young and older participants. The single effect sizes (hits and false alarms)
are standardized mean differences between younger and older participants.

  SMart <- as.data.set(spss.system.file('SMartschuk.sav'))
    ## I'd put the .sav file in my working directory
  faceRec <- as.data.frame(SMart)

  plot (FA ~ MAgeOld, pch=16, cex=1.5, data=SMart)
